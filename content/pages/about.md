Title: About

#### The Nerd Responsible

I'm AJ, a software hacker currently trying to figure out where my Life is going, exactly. Day by day, I'm also learning to [let it go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU).

Secretly, I still want to be [Ellie Arroway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(novel)) when I grow up. (Which is a way of saying I'm *still* hoping to become an astronaut even though I lack both the athletic and intellectual aptitude for such pursuits).

The programming languages I work with include Python, C/C++, Haskell, Clojure, and Ruby. I have the most professional (i.e. paid) experience with Python and Ruby. 

When I'm not writing code from the "comfort" of my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) setup, I can sometimes be found writing prose. Since I use [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as my text editor of choice, and since both writing code and prose involves a text editor, this means I spend approximately 95% of my time in Emacs.

Occasionally, I can also be found tinkering with hardware like the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) microcontrollers, [Google Cardboard](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/), [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com), and whatever electronics I get my hands on, basically.

#### This Site

Mainly, my goal here is to keep a repository of the things I hack around with, which at the moment seems to primarily involve wrestling with Linux OSes. 

#### Testing

I wonder if this will trigger a build.
