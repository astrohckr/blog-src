Over the past few months I have been secretly pining for the days I spent tinkering with my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) system, eagerly digging into configuration files and writing up my own scripts to deal with common tasks that are included in less neckbeard-y systems. 

So sometime towards the last half of April, I decided to return to my neckbeard-y roots, OS X be damned (though I kept it for firmware updates and for Xcode, which we use at work for our iOS app), and wiped my 1st-gen retina Macbook Pro to start fresh.

(Though I do want to emphasize that OS X is not at all a terrible system to use as a developer. In fact, I consider it a very polished UNIX.)

Previous guides published on [vec.io](https://vec.io/posts/use-arch-linux-and-xmonad-on-macbook-pro-with-retina-display) and [codelitt](http://codylittlewood.com/arch-linux-on-macbook-pro-installation/) were immensely helpful in getting set up.

Overall, I found my experience with the install and configuration process far less painful than I remembered when I first tried loading a flavor of Linux on Apple Hardware (on my previous Macbook). Whether it is objectively less of a hassle than it was before, I can't say, but I found myself enjoying every step of the process (which I took as a sign that I was ready to go back to the Land of Linux).

(Perhaps I really am a masochist. I'm not sure.)

I documented as much of the process as I went so as to be able to reference my notes should I choose to repeat the setup rituals. I have published a guide based on my installation and configuration notes over at this [repo](https://github.com/hckr/rmbp-setup-arch-linux) on how to install [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) which I hope will ease the confusion in at least some aspects of the process.

I'll write more about the experience post-install in a future post, but for the moment here is an obligatory screenshot:
