I've been meaning to migrate my rather complex email setup out of the silo of Google even before it was cool to do so (pre-NSA revelations, I mean). This weekend, I finally went ahead and begun the process.

## A list? A list.

First, I had to compile a list of alternatives to the Google Services I'd been using. While there were certainly excellent alternatives that offered all the basic services I need (email, calendar/contacts), I wanted to avoid relying on one service alone for these things.

Here was the list of finalists:

1. Email: [Fastmail](https://fastmail.fm)
2. Calendar/Contacts Sync: [OwnCloud](http://owncloud.org)
3. Document Sync: [Bittorrent Sync (btsync)](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync)

## Simplifying my email setup

Over the years, I've hoarded a lot of email addresses to which I directed specific pieces of information. I thought I was being clever by doing this, but as I get older, I'd rather not have to log on to several different gmail accounts to retrieve a password, to check up on my neopets that have been dying for 10 years, to store my plans for world domination, etc. 

### Subdomain emails!

I thought, "gee, I wish there was some way I could have subdomain emails like food@eatspam.myemail.com on the fly so I don't have to be annoyed with LinkedIn emails on my main inbox."

Well, it turns out that [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.fm) does this exact thing. The plus sign trick for Gmail (where you can have harry+poop@gmail.com point to harry@gmail.com) was cool, but this was even better.

### Rules rule and disposable addresses

Instead of filters, Fastmail has rules. With the email subdomain thing I mentioned above, the amount of control you have over where certain types of emails go is incredible.

Let's say you go on a date that turns out rather poorly, but you want to give the person another chance and the fellow or lady asks you for your email address. Well, fear not, for you can give them an email like this:

```
somewhat@nnoying.mycoolemail.com
```

And if the second date turns out even worse than the first one, you can always set up a rule to delete emails received at that address automatically. You'll break your date's heart, but...

(I don't know where I'm going with this...)

### Aliases/Personalities

The other cool thing you can do with Fastmail is having different personalities as would befit the situation. Since I am a person of a confusing array of online identities and am not clever enough to manage them all, this feature is killer.

## A more detailed guide...coming soon!

I promise I'll post a more detailed guide as to the process I undertook to do this migration.

To be continued....
