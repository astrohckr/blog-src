title: Pelican-generated, Bitbucket-hosted

Since I primarily work in Python and mercurial-land now, I decided I might as well take this stuff out for a spin.

This site is now generated using [Pelican](http://getpelican) and hosted on [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). 

I chose [svbhack](https://github.com/gfidente/pelican-svbhack) as the theme because I'm a sucker for minimalist themes reminiscent of [other](http://svbtle.com) publishing platforms.
